# Cyber-Physical System Project

This repository hosts the codebase and documentation for a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) project. CPS integrates computation with physical processes, embedding sensors and networks into the environments they control.

## Overview

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are systems in which a mechanism is controlled or monitored by computer-based algorithms. This project aims to demonstrate the principles of CPS through a sample application that showcases how physical and software components can be integrated to form a functional system.

## Features

- Integration of physical processes with computational models.
- Real-time data acquisition and processing.
- Simulation of cyber-physical interaction.
- Examples of control strategies for various physical systems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites here, including any platform-specific requirements or dependencies that need to be installed.

```bash
{# Example of installing dependencies}
